Temples
— ALL tiles can be used to exchange for a captured tile in the temples. (aka not only orchid and ginseng)

White Lotus
— Capturing is only possible when both White Lotus' are outside Temples. (aka all effects can be applied even though Lotus are inside temples)

Neutral Garden
— According to the original rules, tiles fully inside a Neutral Garden cannot be affected by lion turtle and original benders' abilities. That is not a rule in Ginseng 2.0. Aka, tiles can be affected even if they are fully inside a neutral garden.
