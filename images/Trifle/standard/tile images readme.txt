--Trifle Tile Readme--

Just a spot to keep notes on the progress made with the tiles, including status of tiles, which ones are good,
which need to be improved etc. 

xx = bleh
x = bad
~ = okay 
^ = like
^^ = love


~  Airbanner - okay, could be neater. 
^^ Glider - Good! 
^^ Badger - og
^  BoarQPine - Not bad, maybe having the entire ball filled in is a bit much. Good size, might consider. 
^^ Chrys - og 
^^ dragon - og 
^  Earthbanner - the original earth banner looks too much like the rock. While we could use the rock here, I like the extra patterns 
~  Edelweiss - like the concept, might not work too well online/with laser. 
x  Firefly - its okaay, not a fan tbh. 
^^ Firelily - og 
^^ Lilypad - I like this one, gets the symbolism well. 
^^ Lotus - OG
^  MessengerHawk - this is tricky, because I don't mind this design, but I also really like the one already in place, in drafts. 
^  PolarBearDog - The double dog worked well, but could improved. 
^  RingTailedLemur - nice! I like. 
^  SaberToothMooseLion - I like this one too, gets the symbol type right. 
~  Shirshu - its pretty good, I like, but could be improved I think. 
^^ Skybison - OG
^  TitanArum - I like! 
^^ WaterBanner - I love, I think this looks as good as I can get it. 
^^ Wheel - OG
^^ HermitCrab - Nice style, works!
^^ Dandelion - Looks good, nice style!
^^ Lupine - Very nice!
^^ BuffaloYak - This double still works well too! 

Don't know if each animal should be the same style of having a double sillohette or just a front face. The shirshu and moose look nice with 
straight on face icons, but don't match the other icons. 




--other ideas--
Fire banner - gotta have the fire nation attacks 
Unagi - this would be a cool aquatic animal! Similar look to the dragon, except tail detatched, flipped and under water. 
Boomerang - What, we have time for YOUR glider and YOUR water scrolls (banner), and not MY BOOMERANG???
Cacuts - its the quenchiest!
Maybe reuse some of the ancient oasis tiles for something too? I'd love to include the lionturtle, it's my fave. 

Comments on ideas in Skud's doc. 
I love the landmark tile ideas, if they could work. 
Snow wolf - cool
Koi! Please! 
Ostritch horse - real cool, original silohette. 
Mongoose lizard - nice
Komodo Rhino - oooo
If the 'sprits' idea ever comes, that would make for some really cool tiles too. 
The Flying Boar of the Bei Fong family!

As for the flowers - I haven't quite gotten good at flower designs yet, but the cool ones would be 
	Panda lily 
	Moon/sun flower 
	Coconut
	^^Bamboo! Love the idea, could be hard/impossible irl
	Gripping grass - just use knotweed?
